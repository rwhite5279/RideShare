README - RideShare Project
=================

Overview
--------

The RideShare project simulates a series of Uber-style cars traveling
from a single starting point to a single destination, in one direction
or another, along a 31-mile stretch of road, with pickup spots (stations)
located at each mile.

Notes
-----

This branch of the project has been almost entirely decimated in terms
of its code. JavaDocs remain for much of the project, but implementation
details (in most cases) have been left for the student to explore and
develop.

A paper version of some working code may be availble in the classroom.
Ultimately, it is hoped that students will work their way through most
of the interesting parts of this assignment independently or with little
help.
